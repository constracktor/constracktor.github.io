    abstract = {Hydrodynamics And Radiation Diffusion (HARD) is an open-source application for high-performance simulations of compressible hydrodynamics with radiation-diffusion coupling. Built on the FleCSI (Bergen et al., 2021 [1]) (Flexible Computational Science Infrastructure) framework, HARD expresses its computational units as tasks whose execution can be orchestrated by multiple back-end runtimes, including Legion (Bauer et al., 2012 [2]), MPI (Forum, 1994 [3]), and HPX (Kaiser et al., 2020 [4]). Node-level parallelism is handled through Kokkos (Edwards et al., 2014 [5]), providing a single-source, portable code base that runs efficiently on laptops, small homogeneous clusters, and the largest heterogeneous supercomputers currently available. To ensure scientific reliability, HARD includes a regression test suite that automatically reproduces canonical verification problems such as the Sod and LeBlanc shock tubes, and the Sedov blast wave, comparing numerical solutions against known analytical results. The project is distributed under an OSI-approved license, hosted on GitHub, and accompanied by reproducible build scripts and continuous integration workflows. This combination of performance portability, verification infrastructure, and community-focused development makes HARD a sustainable platform for advancing radiation hydrodynamics research across multiple domains.},

    abstract="Python is the de-facto language for software development in artificial intelligence (AI). Commonly used libraries, such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, rely on parallelization built into their BLAS backends to achieve speedup on CPUs. However, only applying parallelization in a low-level backend can lead to performance and scaling degradation. In this work, we present a novel way of binding task-based C++ code built on the asynchronous runtime model HPX to a high-level Python API using pybind11. We develop a parallel Gaussian process (GP) library as an application. The resulting Python library GPRat combines the ease of use of commonly available GP libraries with the performance and scalability of asynchronous runtime systems. We evaluate the performance on a mass-spring-damper system, a standard benchmark from control theory, for varying numbers of regressors (features). The results show almost no binding overhead when binding the asynchronous HPX code using pybind11. Compared to GPyTorch and GPflow, GPRat shows superior scaling on up to 64 cores on an AMD EPYC 7742 CPU for training. Furthermore, our library achieves a prediction speedup of 7.63 over GPyTorch and 25.25 over GPflow. If we increase the number of features from eight to 128, we observe speedups of 29.62 and 21.19, respectively. These results showcase the potential of using asynchronous tasks within Python-based AI applications.",

    abstract="Parallel algorithms relying on synchronous parallelization libraries often experience adverse performance due to global synchronization barriers. Asynchronous many-task runtimes offer task futurization capabilities that minimize or remove the need for global synchronization barriers. This paper conducts a case study of the multidimensional Fast Fourier Transform to identify which applications will benefit from the asynchronous many-task model. Our basis is the popular FFTW library [7]. We use the asynchronous many-task model HPX and a one-dimensional FFTW backend to implement multiple versions using different HPX features and highlight overheads and pitfalls during migration. Furthermore, we add an HPX threading backend to FFTW. The case study analyzes shared memory scaling properties between our HPX-based parallelization and FFTW with its pthreads, OpenMP, and HPX backends. The case study also compares FFTW's MPI+X backend to a purely HPX-based distributed implementation. The FFT application does not profit from asynchronous task execution. In contrast, enforcing task synchronization results in better cache performance and thus better runtime. Nonetheless, the HPX backend for FFTW is competitive with existing backends. Our distributed HPX implementation based on HPX collectives using MPI parcelport has similar performance to FFTW's MPI+OpenMP. However, the LCI parcelport of HPX accelerated communication up to factor 5.",

    abstract="Gaussian processes are a widely used alternative to neural networks for non-linear system identification. The method requires computing the inversion of a large covariance matrix. In this work, we introduce our new task-based asynchronous implementation, focusing on its most popular solver, the Cholesky decomposition. Our implementation is based on HPX, utilizing its asynchronous many-task runtime system. We can therefore investigate its scaling on multi-core hardware and for GPU offloading. Furthermore, we compare our HPX implementation against a high-level reference implementation based on PETSc. We demonstrate that the HPX implementation's performance is directly tied to the chosen tile size. Compared to the PETSc reference, our task-based implementation is faster in the entire node-level strong scaling experiment on EPYC ROME, showing better parallel efficiency.",
