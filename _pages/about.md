Alexander is a dedicated computer scientist focused on bridging the gap between High-Performance Computing (HPC) and real-world applications in Scientific Computing and Artificial Intelligence.
Since 2022, he has been a researcher in the Scientific Computing Department at the Institute for Parallel and Distributed Systems at the University of Stuttgart, Germany.
He earned both his Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Computational Engineering from the University of Stuttgart and is currently pursuing a PhD, where he investigates the applicability of Asynchronous Many-Task (AMT) systems across a range of computing domains.

Alexander’s research interests include task-based runtime systems, performance portability, and parallel programming models for heterogeneous architectures.
He is particularly interested in the design and evaluation of AMT systems for large-scale scientific simulations and AI workloads, with a focus on scalability, efficiency, and programmability.
His work explores how asynchronous parallelization techniques can improve resource utilization, enhance performance on emerging computing platforms, and support the next generation of HPC applications.
